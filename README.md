To-Do App - UI Recreation Project

Project Overview
This is a practice project where I recreated a To-Do app solely based on a reference image. The goal was to replicate the UI and functionality without access to the original design specs or code, demonstrating my ability to interpret visual designs and implement them independently.
Features

✅ Task Management: Add, edit, and delete tasks.
✅ Visual Fidelity: Faithful recreation of the reference UI (layout, colors, typography).
✅ Interactive Elements: Checkbox toggles, input fields, and buttons.
✅ Responsive Design: Adapts to different screen sizes (if applicable).
